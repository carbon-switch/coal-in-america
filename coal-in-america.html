				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>Ever since coal emissions peaked in 2012 they've fallen quickly. But in 2020 coal plants still
				emitted about 1 billion tons per year. That's 21% of the country's total.</p>
				<p>And while the coal industry is certainly not going to roar back to life anytime soon,
				emissions from coal power plants are expected to be as high as 400m tons in 2030.</p>

						<p>Coal emissions began declining in America for two main reasons: </p>
						<ol>
							<li>The fracking boom in America that led to a fall in natural gas prices; </li>
							<li> The dramatic fall in the price of renewable energy.</li>
						</ol>
						<p> Let's look at how those two changes affected coal emissions.</p>

				<h2>When did we build power plants?</h2>
				<p>In order to understand both the rise and fall of coal it's helpful to understand when we
				built both coal and all other types of power plants (after all, power plants consume 93% of all coal in America)</p>
				<p>Below is a chart showing the total added capacity of power plants by year and generation type.</p>
